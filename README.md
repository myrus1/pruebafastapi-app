# REST API Deployment Project

## Overview

This project consists of developing and deploying a REST API with an automated pipeline that handles building, testing, and container deployment.  
The goal is to demonstrate knowledge of DevOps practices, CI/CD workflows, and containerized environments.

FastAPI was chosen as the framework in order to quickly create a functional API prototype.  
The main focus of this project is not on the business logic itself, but on building and automating the deployment process through containerization and continuous integration.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a fully containerized REST API and implement an automated deployment pipeline.  
The process includes source retrieval, build automation, and deployment into a containerized environment.  
Swagger documentation is included to validate the API endpoints and responses.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** FastAPI  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **CI/CD Options:** Jenkins or GitHub Actions  
- **Dependency Management:** pip + requirements.txt  
- **Documentation:** Swagger (auto-generated by FastAPI)

---

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular structure composed of:
- A Python-based REST API with FastAPI.
- A Docker container used for consistent environment setup.
- A CI/CD pipeline configured to build and deploy the service automatically.

## Project Structure

- **/src** â€” Contains the application source code.  
- **/docker** â€” Contains Docker-related configuration files.  
- **/ci-cd** â€” Contains Jenkinsfile or GitHub Actions workflow files.  
- **/docs** â€” Documentation, including Swagger configuration and endpoint descriptions.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Source Retrieval:** Clone the repository from a Git-based source.  
2. **Build Stage:** Install dependencies and prepare the environment.  
3. **Containerization:** Build the Docker image for the API service.  
4. **Deployment:** Run the application inside a Docker container.  
5. **Validation:** Verify the API is running correctly and accessible via Swagger UI.

---

## Execution Instructions

The application can be built and deployed using standard Docker commands or an automated CI/CD workflow.  

```bash
  docker compose up --build
```

Ensure all environment variables and configurations are properly defined before deployment.
